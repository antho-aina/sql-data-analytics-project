# sql-data-analytics-project

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.


This repository contains **SQL-based analytics projects** built on top of a curated data warehouse.  
The source data warehouse is in a separate repository: 
[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-Repo-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/antho-aina/sql-data-warehouse-project.git))


The warehouse already applies **all cleaning, transformations, and business rules**, so this repository focuses exclusively on **analytics, reporting**.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focuses on understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within a dataset. It is typically the first step in any data analysis process.

1. **Database Exploration**: Investigating the structure, tables, and relationships within the database.
2. **Dimensions Exploration**: Explore the structure of dimension tables.
3. **Date Exploration**: Understand the range of historical data.
4. **Measures Exploration (Big Numbers)**: Reviewing measures (numerical data) and key metrics.
5. **Magnitude**: Assessing the scale and impact of different measures.
6. **Ranking (Top N - Bottom N)**: Identifying highest and lowest performing entities.

## 📈 Advance Analytics

7. **Change-Over-Time (Trends)**: Analyzing how metrics evolve over time.
8. **Cumulative Analysis**: Aggregating data to understand total impact or progression.
9. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and outcomes.
10. **Part-to-Whole (Proportional)**: Understanding how components contribute to a whole.
11. **Data Segmentation**: Dividing data into meaningful groups for targeted analysis.
12. **Reporting**: Communicating findings through dashboards, summaries, and visualizations.
